    <h1>Instructions for Xavier's Map Mania!</h1>
    <p>Welcome to Map Mania! The game of Map Mania is simple, you must find locations placed around Europe.
        These locations are the places I visited as a backpacking trip with two of my best friends. <br>
        If you are stuck, and cannot find the current location, click on the Hint button and you will be given a hint
        for that location. There will only be 2 hints per location. <br> 
        You must have your zoom level at 5 or 6 to be able to find the locations. Your scoring will be based off how many 
        locations are found and how many hints used. <br> There will be two additional buttons, the first one is to quit which 
        will stop the game and give score for the game. The second will be a cheat button, incase you are lazy and a bum. <br>
        <br>Scoring Guidelines: <br> Location Found: +5 points <br> Hints Used: -2 points
        <br><br> There is a cheat button if you want to be a lazy bum and not complete this game.
