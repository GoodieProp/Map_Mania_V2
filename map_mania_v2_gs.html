    <h1>Instructions for Xavier's Map Mania!</h1>
    <p>Welcome to Map Mania! The game of Map Mania is simple, you must find locations placed around Europe.
        <br>These locations are the places I visited as a backpacking trip with two of my best friends. <br>
        On the top of the page you can see both the hints and the score you have. <br>
        There is a total of 16 places to found around Europe. There is a maximum of 80 points.<br>
        <br>You must be in zoom level 10 to find these places. <br>
        <b>Before you start the game you should inspect element on the top white space area and go to console</b><br>
        You will be told in the console if you're inbound and what zoom level you are in.  <br> 

        <br>Scoring Guidelines: <br> Location Found: +5 points <br> Hints Used: -2 points
        <br><br> There is a cheat button if you want to be a lazy bum and not complete this game.

    </p>
